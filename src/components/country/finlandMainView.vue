                    <h1>Brief History and Significance</h1>
                    <p>Helsinki was founded in 1550 by King Gustav I of Sweden, originally intended as a rival trading
                        town to Tallinn across the Gulf of Finland. However, the city remained relatively small and
                        insignificant until the early 19th century when Finland was ceded to Russia, and Helsinki was
                        made the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812. This marked a turning point in the
                        city's history, leading to significant urban development and growth. The neoclassical
                        architecture that defines much of Helsinki’s city center, including the Senate Square and
                        Helsinki Cathedral, dates back to this period</p>
                    <p>Throughout the 20th century, Helsinki continued to grow and modernize, becoming a major European
                        capital. The city played a pivotal role during the Winter War and the Continuation War between
                        Finland and the Soviet Union. In the post-war era, Helsinki emerged as a center of design and
                        innovation, famously hosting the 1952 Summer Olympics and becoming a UNESCO City of Design in
                        2012. Today, Helsinki is recognized for its forward-thinking urban planning, vibrant cultural
                        life, and commitment to sustainability</p>
